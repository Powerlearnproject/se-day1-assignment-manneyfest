#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software to ensure reliability, efficiency, and scalability.
Importance in the Technology Industry:
Enhances Software Quality – Ensures software is reliable, secure, and efficient.
Increases Productivity – Streamlined processes improve development speed and resource management.
Ensures Scalability – Enables software to handle growth and changing user needs.
Reduces Costs – Proper planning and testing minimize errors, reducing long-term expenses.
Drives Innovation – Supports the creation of new technologies in AI, cybersecurity, and more.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering Complexity – Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
As software systems became more complex, structured programming (e.g., using loops, conditionals, and functions) was introduced to improve code readability and maintainability
Mastering Process – Emergence of Software Development Methodologies (1980s-1990s)
To improve project management, software engineering adopted methodologies like the Waterfall model, Agile, and DevOps to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and adaptability.
Mastering Machine – Advancements in High-Level Programming Languages & AI (2000s-Present)
The development of high-level languages (e.g., Python, Java, C#) made software engineering more accessible and reduced dependency on low-level machine code.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements Gathering – Identifying user needs and system requirements to define project scope.

Design – Creating system architecture, database structures, and user interface designs based on requirements.

Implementation (Coding) – Writing and developing the actual software using programming languages.

Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs through unit, integration, and system testing to ensure quality.

Deployment – Releasing the software for end users, either as a full launch or in phases.

Maintenance – Updating, fixing issues, and improving software based on user feedback and new requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology follows a linear, sequential approach, where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) is completed before moving to the next. It is well-documented, predictable, and best suited for projects with fixed requirements. However, it lacks flexibility, making it difficult to accommodate changes once development starts
Waterfall is ideal for large-scale projects with well-defined requirements, such as government systems, banking software, or aerospace projects, where changes are costly and strict compliance is required.

Agile Methodology is an iterative, flexible approach, where development is broken into small cycles called sprints. Agile focuses on continuous feedback, adaptability, and collaboration. It allows for rapid adjustments based on user feedback, but it can be less predictable in terms of time and budget.
Agile works best for dynamic projects with evolving requirements, such as mobile apps, e-commerce platforms, or AI-driven applications, where frequent updates and user feedback shape the final product.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software 
engineering team.

Software Developer – Designs, codes, and implements software applications. Collaborates with the team to develop features, fix bugs, and optimize performance.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Ensures software quality by conducting testing (manual and automated), identifying defects, and verifying that the product meets requirements before release.
Project Manager – Oversees project planning, resource allocation, and timeline management. Ensures effective communication between stakeholders and ensures the project stays on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide a centralized workspace for coding, debugging, and testing, improving developer efficiency. They include features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse
VCS helps track code changes, enable collaboration, and maintain a history of modifications, ensuring code integrity and rollback options. It is essential for team-based development and managing software versions.
Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complexity – Large projects can become overwhelming.
Debugging & Fixing Bugs – Identifying and resolving issues can be time-consuming.
Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes – New frameworks and tools emerge frequently.
Meeting Project Deadlines – Balancing time constraints with quality is challenging.
Effective Collaboration & Communication – Misunderstandings can slow down progress.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions of the software to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
Importance: Detects early bugs, improves code quality, and simplifies debugging.
Integration Testing – Checks how different modules or components interact with each other.
Importance: Identifies interface defects and ensures seamless data flow between integrated parts.
System Testing – Evaluate the entire software system as a whole to verify that it meets requirements.
Importance: Ensures the software works correctly in its intended environment.
Acceptance Testing – Conducted by end users or clients to confirm that the software meets business needs and requirements.
Importance: Validates that the software is ready for deployment and meets user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and optimizing input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. It involves structuring queries effectively to achieve the desired output.
Importance in Interacting with AI Models
Enhances AI Performance – Well-designed prompts improve response accuracy and relevance.
Increases Efficiency – Reduces trial and error when obtaining precise answers from AI.
Improves User Experience – Ensures AI outputs are clear, context-aware, and useful.
Expands AI Applications – Enables AI to assist in coding, writing, data analysis, and problem-solving.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"How can we solve e-waste problems in Nairobi?"

Improved Prompt:
"What are the most effective government policies and community initiatives that can help reduce e-waste in Nairobi, considering current recycling infrastructure and public awareness?"

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Clarity – Specifies the focus on policies and community initiatives rather than a broad, undefined solution.
Specificity – Narrows the scope to government action, recycling infrastructure, and public awareness, making it easier to generate actionable insights.
Context-Awareness – Tailors the prompt to Nairobi’s existing e-waste landscape, leading to more relevant responses.
Conciseness – Removes vague terms and directly asks for effective strategies, ensuring a focused and practical answer.
